# Practicing HTML and CSS

Welcome to NukaTweets, a Twitter clone project that I'm working on as part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. This project allows me to apply and enhance my HTML and CSS skills, as well as dive into JavaScript and localStorage. My goal is to create a mock version of Twitter to practice and showcase my skills and knowledge.

This project comes with some core functionality:
- Working counters for likes, replies, and retweets.
- Replies are interactive and toggle visibility when clicked.
- Users can add a message by typing in the input field and clicking the "Tweet" button.

My goals for this project are to add the following functionality:
- Allow a user to delete a tweet
- Save tweets, likes and retweets to localStorage
- Add the ability to reply to a specific tweet
- Personalize the project to become my own

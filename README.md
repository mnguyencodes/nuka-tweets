# NukaTweets

Welcome to NukaTweets, a Twitter clone project that I'm working on as part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. This project allows me to apply and enhance my HTML and CSS skills, as well as dive into JavaScript and localStorage. My goal is to create a mock version of Twitter to practice and showcase my skills and knowledge.

This project comes with some core functionality:
- Working counters for likes, replies, and retweets.
- Replies are interactive and toggle visibility when clicked.
- Users can add a message by typing in the input field and clicking the "Tweet" button.

## Project Goals (DONE)
~~- Allow a user to delete a tweet~~
~~- Save tweets, likes and retweets to localStorage~~
~~- Add the ability to reply to a specific tweet~~
~~- Personalize the project to become my own~~

## Known Limitations
When clicking on the like/retweet icons, the page state is reset. For example, if a user uses the keyboard to like a tweet, the keyboard cursor position is reset. ~~Additionally, if a user deletes a post using the trash can or views replies, and then clicks the like/retweet icons, the deleted post and viewed replies are reset to their default state.~~

This occurs due to the page re-rendering, as JavaScript resets the state to default. This behavior persists as of now, but improvements are being explored.

## Installation
To run this project locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
